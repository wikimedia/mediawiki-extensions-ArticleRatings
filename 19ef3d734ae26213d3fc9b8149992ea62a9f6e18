      "message": "*De facto* the compatibility policy for ARE and [other extensions I (quasi-)maintain](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:Jack_Phoenix/extensions) is \"latest LTS only\" as I test and develop (only) against that. If others wish to pretend that the REL_* branches are something else than an automatically created mistake, then fine, but I can\u0027t accept any responsibility over that, of course. Sadly my time is limited and I\u0027m just not able to test all currently supported branches, so I have to stick with the one that\u0027s most likely going to be used by end-users, as the lifespan of non-LTS releases is pretty short.",
