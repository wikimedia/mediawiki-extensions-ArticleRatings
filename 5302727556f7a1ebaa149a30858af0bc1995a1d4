If it is meant to be configurable, then it cannot have a default value that depends on other configuration when that is still in flux. Perhaps this should be merged at run-time somewhere where it is consumed by merging ARENamespaces and ContentNamespaces there.\n\nOr perhaps this is unused and usage can be replaced by calling getContentNamespaces directly - which is what would happen if we merge this as-is, it would become immutable and thus not useful.",
